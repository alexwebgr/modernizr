# modernizr

this is a repository for creating a suitable bower package, it contains the development version of the [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) library 
currently pointing at 2.8.3
An effort will be made to be kept in sync with latest version of the library. Feel free to send a message or
a pull request should you need a different version or a specific build.
